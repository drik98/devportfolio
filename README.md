# Dev Portfolio

This repo contains my portfolio showcasing a few of my projects as well as displaying my CV.
It was originally forked from the static html template of [RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio) but since has evolved into a next.js app which leverages static side generation to allow an easier
maintenance of the website.
