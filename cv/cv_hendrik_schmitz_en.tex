    \section{About}

    In my eight-year professional career, I have gained extensive experience in frontend development, specializing in Vue.js. In addition, I have extensive knowledge of the back-end, having primarily worked with Java and Kotlin before. This experience allows me to collaborate effectively on both front-end and back-end development and ensure seamless integrations.
    \newline Thanks to my in-depth expertise and extensive experience, I am able to work effectively with various stakeholders in software development, including product owners, designers, backend developers and DevOps experts.
